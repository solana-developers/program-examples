Solana Agent Kit is an open-source toolkit that lets AI agents (using any model) interact autonomously with Solana protocols. 

It provides ready-made tools and plugins for token and NFT operations, DeFi actions, cross-chain bridging, market data, and AI 

integrations (LangChain, Vercel AI), so agents can perform on-chain tasks like trading, minting, staking, compressed airdrops and more.
